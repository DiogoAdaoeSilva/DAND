    "This notebook is my project 'Wrangle Open Street Map Data' submission. 'Data wrangling' is what the process of collecting and cleaning data is often called. Having completed the project means I am able to:\n",
    "- Assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.\n",
    "- Parse and gather data from an xml file.\n",
    "- Process data from a very large file that can be cleaned programmatically.\n",

    "[OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is built by a community of mappers that contribute and maintain data about roads, buildings, restaurants, railway stations and much more, all over the world. Since any person can register on OSM and start editing a map, it is only natural that some of the data is not valid, accurate, complete, consistent or uniform."

    "The first look at the data was through the Unix less command in terminal, since opening the file in a text editor is not recommended due to its very large size. Using [create_sampleosm.py](https://github.com/DiogoAdaoeSilva/DAND/blob/master/p3/create_sampleosm.py), a small sample of the data was generated to make it easier to audit and iterate through the data.\n",
    "### Elements\n",
    "With the [mapparser.py](https://github.com/DiogoAdaoeSilva/DAND/blob/master/p3/mapparser.py) script a dictionary with the different elements and their respective number of occurences within the sample dataset was generated:\n",

    "In the OSM data model, the three main mapping elements are: **nodes**, which represent points such as a local business; **ways**, which are linear features like roads or area boundaries like buildings; and **relations**, which explain how multiple elements can be connected, for e.g. multiple nodes that belong to a bus route.\n",
    "### Tag elements\n",
    "Tags are child elements of nodes, ways and relations, and consist of two attributes, a key 'k' and a value 'v', that describe the meaning of the particular element to which they are attached. The script [viewtagtypes.py](https://github.com/DiogoAdaoeSilva/DAND/blob/master/p3/viewtagtypes.py) allows us to have a look at the most common tags in the sample dataset:\n",
